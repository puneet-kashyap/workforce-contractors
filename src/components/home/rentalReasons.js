  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Minimum Inventory',
    reason: `Ownership can be very expensive when equipment is idle. Combining ownership of basic equipment with rental equipment as needed will minimize idle time.`
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Right Equipment for the Right Job',
    reason: `Eliminate the hidden costs of inefficiency due to use of wrong size or type of equipment and the maintenance and repair incurred. Agricultural equipment rentals from our Brantford location ensures the right equipment for the job.`
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: 'Storage',
    reason: `Use of rental equipment eliminates the need for large storage area/buildings; thus, overhead in your costs of doing business is minimized.`
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: 'Breakdowns',
    reason: `Virtually all equipment is subject to occasional breakdowns. However, when rented equipment breaks down, idle time is minimized by replacement equipment from the rental company and repair costs are eliminated.`
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: 'Maintenance',
    reason: `Rented equipment includes full maintenance, no repair shop, no spare parts inventory, no mechanics, and no added payroll.`
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    title: 'Equipment Obsolescence',
    reason: `Ownership of equipment involves the risk of rising wage costs and slower job completion time due to owning worn, obsolete models, when new, better, faster models of farm equipment are available from our rental company.`
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    title: 'Disposal Costs',
    reason: `Preparing used, obsolete equipment for re-sale, advertising, and selling time are factors of ownership that do not occur in renting.`
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    title: 'Cost Control',
    reason: `Knowing the true costs of owned equipment is difficult. Rented equipment offers you just one accountable cost figure, the rental invoice cost.`
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    title: 'Conservation of Capital',
    reason: `Renting equipment frees your capital for other potentially more profitable uses.`
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    title: 'Increase in Borrowing Capital',
    reason: `Contractors who rent instead of purchase find borrowing easier with a better ratio of assets and liabilities since equipment does not appear as a liability on the balance sheet.`
